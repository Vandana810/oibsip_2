            Whether it was his career in science or politics,APJ Abdul Kalam,
            former President of India,
            inspired people across the world.
            Fondly called India's 'Missile man',
            Dr Kalam was particularly closed to young people
            and he loved to be among students.<br><br>

            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931,
            at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu.
            His life as a student was very challenging,
            filled with hardships and struggles.
            There was a time when he had to sell newspapers from door to door
            to support his family and education.<br><br>

            But his commitment towards education was such that
            he overcame all hardships and achieved excellence not only in academics;
            but also held the highest constitutional post in India.
            He will remain as a role model for generations to come.
